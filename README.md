# Botify
A simple Autohotkey script to simulate $potify premium.

This app simply mutes your $potify window when ads come on and unmutes it when they are over. Improvements and comments are welcome.

To run this script, first download AutoHotkey at https://autohotkey.com/. Then double-click mutespotify3.1.ahk and your simulated premium experience will begin!
